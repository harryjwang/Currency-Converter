# Currency-Converter

Harry Wang - 1A ECE at University of Waterloo

In this code, the purpose is so that users can input any currency in the world and find the conversions to other rates.

Right now, there are a lot of formulas for the derivation of differnet currencies. However, a lot of them are rounded and so, it 
is not completely accurate for the conversions. Thus, this app allows users to implement the conversions to get the most accurate
conversions possible.
